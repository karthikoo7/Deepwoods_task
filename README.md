1. Problem Statement
Climate change is a global crisis, but individual actions add up to powerful collective impact. To
make this visible, we want to launch a Climate Action Pledge Microsite that lets students,
working professionals, and the general public:
● Take a voluntary pledge for climate-positive habits
● Record their commitments in a simple form
● Receive a digital certificate instantly
● Get featured on a public Pledge Wall to inspire others
● See live key metrics showing how the community is growing
This will be a responsive single-page website that is clear, motivating, and easy for first-time
users.
The backend can be simulated using Google Sheets or dummy data. The final version should
be deployable as a site on WordPress.
